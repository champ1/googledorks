8,sQL data dumps,"""# Dumping data for table""","sQL database dumps. LOTS of data in these. So much data, infact, I'm pressed to think of what else an ev1l hax0r would like to know about a target database.. What's that? Usernames and passwords you say? Patience, grasshopper....."
9,bash_history files,intitle:index.of .bash_history,"Ok, this file contains what a user typed at a shell command prompt. You shouldn't advertise this file. You shouldn't flash it to a web crawler. It contains COMMANDS and USERNAMES and stuff... *sigh* Sometimes there aren't words to describe how lame people can be. This particular theme can be carried further to find all sorts of things along these lines like .profile, .login, .logout files, etc. I just got bored with all the combinations..."

11,mysql history files,"intitle:""Index of"" .mysql_history","The .mysql_history file contains commands that were performed against a mysql database. A ""history"" of said commands. First, you shouldn't show this file to anyone, especially not a MAJOR SEARCH ENGINE!

13,Windows 2000 Internet Services,"intitle:""Welcome to Windows 2000 Internet Services""","At first glance, this search reveals even more examples of operating system users enabling the operating system default web server software. This is generally accepted to be a Bad Idea(TM) as mentioned in the previous example. However, the googleDork index on this particular category gets quite a boost from the fact that this particular screen should NEVER be seen by the general public. To quote the default index screen: ""Any users attempting to connect to this site are currently receiving an 'Under Construction page'"" THIS is not the 'Under Construction page.' I was only able to generate this screen while sitting at the console of the server. The fact that this screen is revealed to the general public may indicate a misconfiguration of a much more insidious nature..."
14,IIS 4.0,"intitle:""Welcome to IIS 4.0""","Moving from personal, lightweight web servers into more production-ready software, we find that even administrators of Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) sometimes don't have a clue what they're doing. By searching on web pages with titles of ""Welcome to IIS 4.0"" we find that even if they've taken the time to change their main page, some dorks forget to change the titles of their default-installed web pages. This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. Old code: FREE with operating system.Poor content management: an average of $40/hour. Factory-installed default scripts: FREE with operating system.Getting hacked by a script kiddie that found you on Google: PRICELESS.For all the things money can't buy, there's a googleDork award."
